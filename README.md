## Installation
The necessary libraries to run the code here are found in requirements.txt. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Given a New York City traffic accident data for 2020, we would like to answer questions like Which Borough has recorded the most casualties? Do factors like population density (which is a measure of congestion) affect the number of cases and casualties? Are there seasonal trends? How about peak periods? What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle 1)? What about for fatal accidents specifically? 

## File Descriptions
There is 1 python notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. There are 2 csv files here; the NYC accident dataset and Borough population density dataset.
